                    <h5>Professional</h5>
                    <p>My name is Brandon Haley and I am currently a manager at a cloud hosting company reponsible for
                        ensuring
                        all of our clients'
                        applications and databases are implemented and maintained for a seamless app streaming
                        experience. One of
                        the many notable
                        challanges the team faces day to day is scaling our app install and update deployments across
                        the client
                        base efficiently.
                        As a result, it is imperative we develop automated solutions to deploy simple and/or complex
                        application
                        procedures to attain
                        speed and consistency. I have in-depth scripting experience within the Microsoft Windows
                        environment,
                        leveraging languages such as CMD, PowerShell & AutoIT.</p>

                    <p>Scripting/Programming has been one of my passions I wanted to pursue for a long time and I am
                        fully
                        invested into learning the ins-and-outs
                        of what a developer is and does. As a Manager, I miss the technical process of solving problems
                        and tapping
                        into my creative abilities.
                        I am taking this bootcamp to tap into my passion for coding and eventually open new developer
                        opportunities
                        that allow me to get back into the
                        technical role, or a hybrid non-technical role. My current goal would be to eventually become a
                        DevOps
                        manager after I have
                        gained the needed confidence of a developer.</p>

                    <h5>Private</h5>

                    <p>In my private life, I am married to my wife Melissa (pictured above) and we are proud parents of
                        three
                        fur-babiesüêïüêïüêï (pictured right) who keep us busy. We live in Sugar Hill, Georgia which is
                        where I have
                        lived
                        my whole life.
                        In our spare time, we are avid tennis players, foodies and love to travel the world in search of
                        beautful
                        landscapes.
                        Some countries we have explored thus far: Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Costa Rica and
                        Thailand. We are
                        planning to explore New Zealand, Switzerland and Germany in the future.
                        One interesting fact about me is that I used to DJ in Atlanta and was involved in the music
                        scene. My
                        favorite aspect of music was the technical process of creating tracks which unto this day is
                        still a skill I
                        am learning and has been one of the most difficult challenges I have faced.</p>

                    <p>I am very excited to learn how to code and to become a part of a development team.
                    </p>
